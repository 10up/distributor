# Distributor [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/10up/distributor.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/10up/distributor)
### [Download Latest Stable Version](https://github.com/10up/distributor/archive/stable.zip)
<img alt="distributor icon" src="https://github.com/10up/distributor/blob/master/assets/img/icon.svg" height="45" width="45" align="left"> Distributor is a WordPress plugin that makes it easy to syndicate and reuse content across your websites — whether in a single multisite or across the web.

*You can learn more about Distributor's features at [DistributorPlugin.com](https://distributorplugin.com).*

_Note:_ The latest stable version of the plugin is the _stable_ branch. [Download the stable branch]((https://github.com/10up/distributor/archive/stable.zip)) if you are intending to use the plugin in production.

## Requirements

* PHP 5.6+
* [WordPress](http://wordpress.org) 4.7+
* External connections require HTTP Basic Authentication or [WordPress.com OAuth2](https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/oauth2/) (must be on VIP) be set up on the remote website. For Basic Auth, we recommend the [Application Passwords](https://wordpress.org/plugins/application-passwords/) plugin.
* For external connections, Distributor needs to be installed on BOTH sides of the connection.

## Install

For production use, we recommend [registering and downloading the plugin from DistributorPlugin.com](https://distributorplugin.com/#cta) – it's 100% free. You will be emailed a direct link to download the latest, production-ready build. Alternatively, you can [download the latest master build from GitHub](https://github.com/10up/distributor/archive/master.zip).

You can upload and install the archived (zip) plugin via the WordPress dashboard (Plugins > Add New -> Upload Plugin) or manually inside of the `wp-content/plugins` directory, and activate on the Plugins dashboard.

### Registration

To help inform our roadmap, keep adopters apprised of major updates and changes that could impact their websites, and solicit opportunities for beta testing and feedback, we’re asking for a little bit of information in exchange for a free key that unlocks update notifications and 1-click upgrades inside the WordPress dashboard. Your information is kept confidential. You can [register here](https://distributorplugin.com/#cta) and input your key in Distributor settings in the dashboard (network dashboard for multisite users).

## Plugin Usage

Distributor supports safe, SEO-friendly content reuse and sharing via "pushing" and "pulling".

While logged in and editing or viewing any single post (or custom post type) that can be distributed, a `Distributor` admin bar item will appear, that will facilitate sharing ("pushing") that content to any `connection`.

In the admin dashboard, a top level Distributor menu item links to the "pull" screen. Here, editors can share ("pull") content from any `connection` into the current site.

There are two connection types: `external` and `internal`.
* Internal connections are other sites inside of the same multisite network. Any user logged into the network can distribute any content in the network to any other sites in the network where that user has permission to publish posts (assuming the site supports the same post type).
* External connections are external websites, connected by the JSON REST API. External connections can be added in the WordPress admin dashboard under Distributor > External Connections. Administrators can decide which user roles are allowed to distribute content to and from that connection (Editors and Administrators by default). All users with those roles will inherit the permissions of the user account used to establish the remote connection.

### Gutenberg Support (Beta)

Distributor supports distributing Gutenberg posts but the functionality is currently in beta (as is Gutenberg itself). We expect this functionality to stabilize when Gutenberg is released into WordPress core.

## Known Caveats/Issues

__Remote Request Timeouts__ - With external connections, HTTP requests are sent back and forth - creating posts, transfering images, syncing post updates, etc. In certain situations, mostly commonly when distributing posts with a large number of images (or very large file sizes), using poorly configured or saturated servers / hosts, or using plugins that add significant weight to post creation, Distributor requests can fail. Although we do some error handling, there are certain cases in which post distribution can fail silently. If distribution requests are taking a long time to load and/or failing, consider adjusting the timeout; you can filter the timeout for pushing external posts [here](https://github.com/10up/distributor/blob/master/includes/classes/ExternalConnections/WordPressExternalConnection.php#L487). More advanced handling of large content requests, and improved error handling is on the road map for a future update.

__Post Meta Associations__ - A distributed post includes all of the post meta from the original version. Sometimes arbitrary post meta references an ID for another piece of content on the original site. Distributor _does not_ "bring along" the referenced content or update references for arbitrary post meta (it will take care of updating references in the case of core WordPress features, such as the featured image ID). This issue is very common when using field management plugins like Advanced Custom Fields (ACF). This can be addressed on a case by case basis by extending the plugin; for external connections, you can manually handle post meta associations using [this hook](https://github.com/10up/distributor/blob/master/includes/classes/ExternalConnections/WordPressExternalConnection.php#L512). For internal connections, use [this hook](https://github.com/10up/distributor/blob/master/includes/classes/InternalConnections/NetworkSiteConnection.php#L102).

__Deleting Distributed Posts__ - When a post that has been distributed is deleted, the distributed copies will become unlinked ("forked") from the original and thus become editable. Similarly, when a distributed post is unpublished, distributed copies will not be unpublished. More sophisticated "removal" workflow is on the road map for a future update.

__Gutenberg Block Mismatch__ - When distributing a Gutenberg post to another site that supports Gutenberg, if a block in the post does not exist on the receiving site, the block will be converted to a "Classic" HTML block.

__Parent Posts__ - Distributor does not "bring along" parent (or child posts). If your post (or custom post type) has a parent or a child, it will distribute it as if it's an orphan.

__External Connection Post Type Support__ - When _pulling_ content from an external connection, only "Posts" (post type) content will appear. _Pulling_ other post types from _external_ connections is not currently supported. Internal connections (multisite) support multiple post types, and other post types can still be _pushed_ to external connections that support the post type. This will be addressed in an upcoming release, including an improved interface for navigating available content by post types supported on both sides.

In addition, in order for distribution to work with external connections that have custom post type content, that post type needs to be registered with the argument `show_in_rest => true` on the external site.

__Backwards Compatibility__ - While we strive to be mindful of backwards compatibility much the same way WordPress itself is, we do not currently guarantee continued interoperability between different versions of Distributor. We assume the current userbase for this plugin has a high degree of control over any site that has been set up as an external connection and urge you to keep Distributor up to date.

## Developers

### Testing

The plugin contains a standard test suite compatible with PHPUnit. If you want to test across multiple PHP versions, a [Dockunit](https://github.com/dockunit/dockunit) file is included.

### Debugging

You can define a constant `DISTRIBUTOR_DEBUG` to `true` to increase the ease of debugging in Distributor. This will make all remote requests blocking and expose the subscription post type.

Enabling this will also provide more debugging information in your error log for image side loading issues. The specific logging method may change in the future.
