# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file, per [the Keep a Changelog standard](http://keepachangelog.com/).

## [ 1.2.3 ] - 2018-08-16
* Fixed an issue that was hiding the "As Draft" checkbox on the push screen. We've introduced a new filter "dt_allow_as_draft_distribute" which can be set to false to disable the "as draft" checkbox.

## [ 1.2.2 ] - 2018-08-14
* Fixed an issue where content pulled or skipped from an internal connection (in the Pull interface) would show up as "pulled" across all internal sites / connections. **Backwards compatibility break**: internal posts that were previously skipped or pulled will show as available for pull again in all internal sites.
* Donâ€™t set Distributor meta data on REST API post creation unless post was created by Distributor
* Add helper function to return post statuses that are allowed to be distributed
* Utilize the og:url from Yoast for external connections
